## This repository is to learn how to use this platform. 

<!--
Not really sure how to use all of this.
funny because I need way more sections.
1. be a good steward
2. Take your time
3. listen with your ears first
4. then listen with your mind
5. lastly your heart
6. always pray and keep big GOD first
7. you never know hoe long you have from your last prayer
8. take time to think and develop
9. all of this and I'm still not at the bottom

What are the limits and bounds we're willing to push?
